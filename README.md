# The Kings Brotherhood Project
###  Thank you for visiting this project site! I have put this site together to test front end web elements learned recently. This site is a collection of screenshots from the game Final Fantasy XV.


# Instructions
### There are no special instructions how to view at this time. Simply click here https://calthedragoon.github.io



# Elements
## CSS
### The CSS used for the layout is all custom. There is no Bootstrap involved, I wanted to have a shot at implementing some elements without it for the first time.



## JavaScript/Jquery
### The Javascript involved is used to make the slideshow at the top work, the Jquery I made to show and hide picture text content on the gallery pages.



## Form
### The submit form on the final page does not submit the links to any location at this point. For the moment it simply gives you a basic alert and sends you back to the home page to continue viewing that gallery.

# The Kings Brotherhood Project
###  Thank you for visiting this project site! I have put this site together to test front end web elements learned recently. This site is a collection of screenshots from the game Final Fantasy XV.


# Instructions
### There are no special instructions how to view at this time. Simply click here https://calthedragoon.github.io



# Elements
## CSS
### The CSS used for the layout is all custom. There is no Bootstrap involved at this time while I get a feel for practicing CSS myself.



## JavaScript/Jquery
### The Javascript involved is used to make the slideshow at the top work
### Jquery is involved in making the picture text buttons show and hide the content on the gallery pages.



## Form
### The submit form on the final page does not submit the links to any location at this point. Just pops up an alert that tells you the information has been submitted.
